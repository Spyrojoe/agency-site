					<h2>Every Agency Has People; We Think Ours Are Great.</h2>
					<p class="copy-text">The best work product is the culmination of a lot of people's ideas, thoughts, and opinions.  Who's to say that the creative theme for a digital advertising campaign can't emanate from the programmer or developer?  Or the idea for how a microsite should function comes from the account guy.  Regardless of the size or scope of the project, we engage the same talented resources that may otherwise be working diligently on our agency of record clients.  There is no B team at Apollo, and that is of tremendous value to all of our clients.</p>
